When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

If you are working on a different computer you might want to store your code on
GigHub so that you have your code wherever you are. Also, if you're working with
a team GitHub is a great way for you all to share and work on the same code
remotely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may not want all the files on GitHub. Also, you may want to select
when to pull files.
